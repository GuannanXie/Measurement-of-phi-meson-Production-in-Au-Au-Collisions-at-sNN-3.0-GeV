We report on the first multi-differential measurement of $\phi$ meson and $\Xi^{-}$ hyperon production as well as the $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratio in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ with the STAR experiment under its fixed target configuration at RHIC. $\phi$ mesons and $\Xi^{-}$ hyperons are measured through their hadronic decay channels, $\phi\rightarrow K^+K^-$ and $\Xi^-\rightarrow \Lambda\pi^-$. The transverse kinetic energy spectra of $K^-$, $\phi$ and $\Xi^{-}$ are presented in different centrality and rapidity intervals. The total production yields and the ratios within a $4\pi$ coverage are calculated and compared to thermal model and hadronic transport model predictions. A calculation within the grand canonical ensemble framework shows a clear discrepancy from our measurement. Our data favor the canonical ensemble approach employing local strangeness conservation with a small strangeness correlation length ($r_c \leq 4.2$\,fm) in $\textup{0--10\%}$ central Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. The transport models including the resonance decays can reasonably describe both our measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio at this energy and the trend of $\phi/\Xi^-$ at lower energies.

% \section{Introduction}
% \label{introduction}

Relativistic heavy ion physics is aiming at the detailed investigation of phase structures of strongly interacting matter, governed by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), under extreme conditions of high temperature and density~\cite{akiba2015hot,Busza_ARNPS,StarWhitePaper}. Particle production has been studied to investigate the properties of the produced QCD matter in heavy-ion collisions. The strange quark mass is comparable to the QCD renormalization scale ($\Lambda_{\rm{QCD}}$\,$\sim\textup{200 MeV}$)~\cite{Rafelski:1982pu,Koch:1986ud}, 
%and the temperature of the produced medium
therefore strange quark dynamics plays an important role in understanding the QCD Equation-of-State of hot and dense nuclear matter particularly in the high density region~\cite{KO_sQM17,Danielewicz1592,Tetyana_ICNN,KO.PhysRevLett.55.2661,Ks0_Lambda_HADES,CASSING.openCharm.2001753}. 

Statistical thermal models have often been used to characterize the thermal properties of the produced media~\cite{Andronic_2018Naure,Rafelski_1980279,Cleymans:1992zc,Becattini:1997ii,Florkowski:2001fp,Redlich_CE,Rafelski_PRC}. In these models, grand canonical ensemble (GCE) and canonical ensemble (CE) statistical descriptions can be applied to conserve electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness number in order to compute the final state particle yields. Both GCE and CE models are able to describe various particle yields including strange particles produced in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC at center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$) greater than 7.7\,GeV. It has been argued that at lower energies, strangeness number needs to be conserved locally on an event-by-event basis described by the CE, which leads to a reduction in the yields of hadrons with non-zero strangeness number (``Canonical Suppression")~\cite{Rafelski_1980279,Redlich:2001kb}.

The $\phi(1020)$ meson is the lightest bound state of strange quarks into a pair ($s\bar{s}$) with zero net strangeness number (S=0). %$\phi$ meson production in elementary collisions is suppressed compared to other strange hadrons due to the QCD Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule. 
In the GCE model, the $\phi/K^-$ ratio is expected to fall off as the collision energy decreases towards the threshold. In the CE model, $\phi$ meson production, unlike other strange hadrons ($K^-$, $\Xi^-$, etc.), is not affected by the strangeness canonical suppression.
Therefore, the $\phi/K^-$ ratio is expected to increase with decreasing collision energy in models using the CE treatment for strangeness. The canonical suppression power for $\Xi^-$ is even larger than for $K^-$. The $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios offer a unique test to scrutinize thermodynamic properties of strange quarks in the hot and dense QCD environment.

% ?? do we need this paragraph?
In heavy-ion collisions, the near/sub-threshold production of multi-strange hadrons can be achieved from the multiple collisions of nucleons, produced particles, and short-lived resonances~\cite{ZEEB2004297}. The particle production in heavy-ion collisions below its free nucleon-nucleon (NN) threshold ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ $\sim$2.89\,GeV for $\phi$ and $\sim$3.25\,GeV for $\Xi^-$) is expected to be sensitive to the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state at high density~\cite{yong2021double}, as it is for single-strange hadrons~\cite{KO.PhysRevLett.55.2661,FUCHS20061_kaons}. The near/sub-threshold production further provides the possibility
to observe exotic states of QCD matter~\cite{McLerran:2007qj} and signatures of ``soft deconfinement"~\cite{Fukushima:2020cmk}.
 
Measurements from the experiments at the AGS, SPS, RHIC and LHC show that the $\phi/K^-$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions stays remarkably flat ($\sim$0.15) at collision energies ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} > \textup{5 GeV}}$~\cite{E917_phi,NA49_phi,star_bes_strangeness}. Recent measurements of the $\phi/K^-$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions at collision energies below the $\phi$ free NN-threshold from HADES and FOPI show a hint of relative enhancement compared to those from high energies at RHIC and the LHC~\cite{FOPI_phi_AlAl,FOPI_phi_NiNi,HADES_phi_ArKCl,HADES_phi_AuAu}, indicative of the applicability of the CE description for strangeness production at these energies. 
The RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase-II program, including both collider and fixed target setups with the STAR experiment, covers a center-of-mass energy range of 3.0--19.6\,GeV. This offers a great opportunity to conduct precise measurements of the energy dependence of the $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios at low collision energies, which are crucial in understanding the strangeness dynamics as well as the medium properties in high baryon density regions in QCD.


The dataset used in this analysis consists of Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ collected by the STAR experiment operated under the fixed target (FXT) setup~\cite{Meehan_2016} in the 2018 RHIC run. 
A single beam was provided by RHIC with total energy equal to 3.85 GeV/nucleon and incident on a gold target of thickness 0.25 mm, corresponding to a 1\% interaction probability.
The target is installed inside the vacuum pipe, 2\,cm below the center of the beam axis, and located 200\,cm to the west of the center of the STAR detector. The main detectors used are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC)~\cite{TPC}, the Time of Flight (TOF) detector~\cite{TOF}, and the Beam-Beam Counter (BBC)~\cite{BBC_Whitten}. The trigger is provided by the signal in the east BBC detector and at least five hits in the TOF detector. Tracking and particle identification (PID) are done using the TPC and TOF. Both the TPC and TOF detectors have full azimuthal coverage within a pseudorapidity range of 0$<$\,$\eta$\,$<$\,1.88 for the TPC and 0$<$\,$\eta$\,$<$\,1.5 for the TOF in FXT mode~\cite{TPC,TOF}. Events are selected with the offline reconstructed collision vertex within 1.5\,cm of the target center along the beam direction. Approximately 2.6$\times 10^{8}$ minimum bias (MB) triggered events passed the selection criteria and are used in this analysis. 

The centrality class is selected using measured charged particle multiplicity within the TPC acceptance. 
A Monte Carlo Glauber model, used in conjunction with a negative binomial distribution to model particle production in hadronic collisions, is optimized in order to best match the data and determine the centrality class. Due to the trigger inefficiency in the low multiplicity region (corresponding to the most peripheral collisions), we only report the results from the 0--60\% (0-40\%) centrality class in this paper.

The $\phi$ mesons are reconstructed via the hadronic decay channel $\phi\rightarrow K^+K^-$ with a branching ratio (BR) of 49.2\%, while the $\Xi^{-}$ hyperons via the $\Xi^-\rightarrow \Lambda\pi^-\rightarrow p\pi^-\pi^-$ channel with a BR of 63.8\%~\cite{pdg}. $\Xi^-$ reconstruction is performed using the KF Particle Finder package based on the Kalman Filter method~\cite{Kisel:2018nvd,STAR_PRL_Xi_Oemga_polarization}. The charged tracks are reconstructed with the TPC in a 0.5 T uniform magnetic field. The TPC tracks are required to consist of at least 20 TPC hits (out of a maximum of 45) to ensure good tracking and avoid track splitting (15 TPC hits required for $\Xi^{-}$ to increase the sample of signal candidates). The charged tracks are identified via a combination of the ionization energy loss %($dE/dx$) 
measurement with the TPC and the time-of-flight %($tof$) 
measurement with the TOF. A minimum $p_T$ cut of 0.2 GeV/c is required in the analysis.
%, which have been extensively used in many prior STAR analyses. 
Due to the charge asymmetry for the particle yields at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$, a strict PID criterion requiring both TPC and TOF is implemented for $K^-$~\cite{Xu:2008th,Shao:2005iu}.

Black open circles represent the same-event unlike-sign distribution. The grey shaded histogram represents the normalized mixed-event (rotating daughters for $\Xi^-$) unlike-sign distribution that is used to estimate the combinatorial background.

\label{fig:phiSignal} 
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:phiSignal} (a) shows the invariant mass distribution of $K^+K^-$ pairs in the transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) region of 0.4--1.6 GeV/$c$ for 0--60\% central collisions. The combinatorial background is estimated with the mixed-event (ME) technique in which $K^+$ and $K^-$ from different events of similar characteristics (centrality, event plane angle) are paired. The mixed-event spectra are normalized to the same-event (SE) distributions in the mass range of 1.04--1.08\,GeV/$c^2$. After the subtraction of the combinatorial background, the remainder distribution is shown as red solid circles. The $K^+K^-$ invariant mass remainder distribution is fitted with a Breit-Wigner function for the signal plus a linear function which represents the remaining correlated background ($< 1\%$) from a partial reconstruction of strange hadrons. The $\phi$ meson raw yields are extracted from the Breit-Wigner function fit within the corresponding 3$\sigma$ mass window. The extracted $\phi$ signal shape is consistent with its intrinsic properties convoluted with the detector smearing effect due to finite momentum resolution ($<3\%$ for single track).
Figure~\ref{fig:phiSignal} (b) shows the invariant mass distribution of $\Lambda(p\pi^-)\pi^-$ in the $p_{T}$ region of 0.5--2.0 GeV/$c$ for $\textup{0--40\%}$ central collisions. The combinatorial background is estimated with the rotating daughter (Rot) method, in which a daughter track of $\Xi^-$ is rotated by a random angle between 150 to 210 degrees in the transverse plane. The rotated spectra are normalized to the same-event distributions in the mass ranges of 1.30--1.31 and 1.34--1.35\,GeV/$c^2$. After the combinatorial background is subtracted, the $\Lambda\pi^-$ invariant mass distributions are fitted with a Gaussian for the signal plus a linear function for the remaining correlated background. The $\Xi^-$ raw yields are obtained via histogram bin counting from the invariant mass distributions with all background subtracted within mass windows of 3$\sigma$. The reconstructed $\phi$ meson and $\Xi^-$ acceptances ($p_T$ vs. $y_{cm}$) in the collision center-of-mass frame are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phiSignal} (c) and (d), respectively.
The target is located at $y_{cm}$ = -1.05, using the convention where the beam travels in the positive direction. The red curve represents the TPC and TOF acceptance edge. The reconstructed $\phi$ mesons and $\Xi$ hyperons in this analysis cover the range from the target to mid-rapidity.


The reconstructed $K^-$, $\phi$ meson, and $\Xi^-$ raw yields are calculated in each centrality and $p_{T}$ bin within each rapidity slice. 
The raw yields are corrected for the TPC acceptance and tracking efficiency, %$\varepsilon_{\rm TPC}$, 
the particle identification efficiency, %$\varepsilon_{\rm PID}$ 
and the TOF matching and PID efficiency. The final average reconstruction (including acceptance etc.) efficiency is about 0.30 for the $K^-$, about 0.04 for the $\phi$ meson and about 0.02 for the $\Xi^-$.

Statistical and systematic uncertainties are added quadratically here for plotting.

\label{fig:phimTSpectra} 
\end{figure}

The systematic uncertainty of the raw yield extraction is estimated by changing the histogram fitting method to bin counting method or by changing the fitting ranges. The maximum difference between these scenarios and the default one is considered as one standard deviation. The contribution varies by $p_T$, rapidity, and centrality and the overall contribution is less than 5\% for the invariant yield. The systematic uncertainty in the TPC acceptance and efficiency correction $\varepsilon_{\rm TPC}$ is estimated by varying the cuts on track selection criteria and topological variables (for $\Xi^-$ only). The contribution to the total yield is about 4-5\% for $K^-$, 13-16\% for $\phi$ and 6-10\% for $\Xi^-$. This leads to a 10-13\% (12-18\%) uncertainty in the measured $\phi/K^-$ ($\phi/\Xi^-$) ratio. The uncertainty of the PID efficiency correction is estimated in a similar way by varying the PID selection cuts and the contribution is less than 3\% to the total yield.
For the $p_T$ integrated yield, one important source of systematic uncertainty comes from the extrapolation to the full $p_T$ range due to the limited acceptance. This is estimated by choosing several fitting functions~\cite{STAR_particleYield}. The maximum difference between these scenarios and the default one ($m_T$-exponential) is quoted as one standard deviation from this source. This contribution is 5-7\% for $K^-$, 14-17\% for $\phi$ and 13-15\% for $\Xi^-$. As a cross-check, we conducted the measurement of $\Xi^{-}$ lifetime from the same data and the result, $164.2\pm6.6$ ps is consistent with the PDG value, $163.9\pm1.5$ ps. The corrected $p_T$ spectra are symmetry consistent with respect of y=0 between positive and negative rapidity for the covered $p_T$ range.

The $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio} as a function of collision energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, including the midrapidity data in central Au+Au or Pb+Pb data from the AGS, SPS and RHIC BES at higher energies and $4\pi$\,acceptance data from SIS at lower energies. The black solid circles show our measurements in 0-10\% centrality bin in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. The measured $\phi$, $K^-$ and $\Xi^-$ yields in 4$\pi$ and the $\phi/K^-$, $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios in different centrality bins are listed in Tab.~\ref{table:yieldTratio}. The $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios measured at 3\,GeV are %significantly ($5\sigma$) above the GCE prediction ($\sim$0), and 
slightly higher than the values at high energies for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\geqslant$ 5\,GeV~\cite{NA49_phi,NA49_piK,NA49_piK2,NA49_Xi,E917_phi,ALICE_phi_2p7TeV,STAR_phi_64a200GeV,Xi_ArKCl_HADES,star_bes_strangeness} despite the collision energy being very close to the $\phi$ threshold and below the $\Xi^-$ threshold in NN collisions. %The measured data points follow the energy dependence trend, with the value gradually increasing with decreasing energy at low $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$. %Our measured data points confirmed this enhancement observation which limited by the precision in the previous measurements.

Various curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio} represent the predictions of $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios from several model calculations in central A+A collisions. Statistical model calculations, based on the Grand Canonical Ensemble and Canonical Ensemble for strangeness with several different choices of strangeness correlation length ($r_c$), were calculated using the $\textup{THERMUS}$ package~\cite{THERMUS_WHEATON200984} with energy dependent freeze-out parameters ($T_{\rm ch}$, $\mu_B$) taken from~\cite{Andronic_2018Naure}. These parameters were extracted through a thermal model fit to the particle yields at mid-rapidity. The strangeness number is conserved on average in the GCE. It is clear that the model fails to describe the data at low energies, including our new measurements at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$, which indicates the thermal particle phase-space at low energies is far from the GCE limit and the local treatment of strangeness conservation is crucial~\cite{BraunMunzinger:2003zd}. In the canonical approach, the correlation length, $r_c$, defines a region of the particle production phase space inside which the production of the strangeness is canonically conserved. Both the $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ data from our measurement favor the CE thermodynamics for strangeness with a small strangeness correlation length ($r_c \leq 4.2$\,fm). It is worthwhile to point out that the CE calculations with the same $r_c$ parameter cannot describe our $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ data simultaneously (as also observed in lighter systems and at lower collision energy ~\cite{HADES_phi_ArKCl}). The production yields of $\phi$ and $\Xi^-$ in near/sub-threshold regions based on the thermal model calculations are sensitive to the freeze-out parameters. 
A global thermal model fit with all the particle yields at 3\,GeV will help to precisely determine these thermal parameters in the future.

Previous measurements from smaller collision systems (Ar+KCl and Al+Al collisions) showed comparable or higher $\phi/K^-$ and/or $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios at energies below 3 GeV. The previous measurement in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\textup{2.7 GeV}$ shows that $\phi/K^- = 1.04\pm0.23$ ~\cite{ANKE_phi}. The measurement in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\textup{17.3 GeV}$ shows that $\phi/K^- = 0.11\pm0.01$, comparable to that in central Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions, while $\phi/\Xi^- = 5.09\pm0.36$, significantly larger than that in central Au+Au/Pb+Pb collisions ~\cite{NA61SHINE_pp_piKp,NA61SHINE_pp_phi,NA61SHINE_pp_Xi}. In our measurement at 3 GeV, there is no obvious difference in the $\phi/K^-$ ratio between the \textup{0--10\%} and \textup{10--40\%} central bins, while the result in the most peripheral 40--60\% central bin shows a hint of a larger value, as shown in Tab.~\ref{table:yieldTratio}. Similarly, the $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratio in mid-central collisions seems to be larger than that in central collisions. Overall, these observations are qualitatively consistent with the expectation that a smaller canonical volume in the smaller system leads to a higher observed $\phi/K^-$ and/or $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratio.

Hadronic transport models are widely used in the high baryon density region to study the properties of the produced dense matter~\cite{urQMD,UrQMD_2,Steinheimer_2015_UrQMD,Elfner_SMASH,Hartnack:2011cn,Song:2020clw}. In the modified version of the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model~\cite{Steinheimer_2015_UrQMD}, new decay channels from high mass baryon resonances to $\phi$ and $\Xi^-$ are deployed. The relevant decay branching fraction was determined by fitting the experimental data from $p$+$p$ collisions~\cite{ANKE_phi}. From the comparison shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio}, the modified $\textup{UrQMD}^{2}$ calculation for central ($\rm{b}<5\,\rm{fm}$) Au+Au collisions agrees with the data points at low ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$, including our new measurement for $\phi/K^-$.
%, while the calculation for $\phi/\Xi^-$ currently is not available in this energy. 
However calculations from the public $\textup{UrQMD}^{1}$ model underestimate our measurements for both $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$.   
%while clearly underestimating the measurements at high $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\geqslant$ 5\,GeV.
Another hadronic transport approach called Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons (SMASH) attempts to incorporate the newest available experimental data from both elementary hadronic cross sections and dilepton invariant mass spectra to constrain the resonance branching ratios~\cite{Elfner_SMASH}. The $\phi/K^-$ ratio is reasonably reproduced using SMASH in the smaller system and ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ below $\textup{3 GeV}$, despite the overestimation of each individual ($\phi$, $K^-$) transverse mass spectrum measured, e.g. in Au+Au $\textup{0-40\%}$ system by HADES~\cite{Elfner_SMASH,HADES_phi_AuAu}. The predicted $\phi/K^-$ ratio from the same model is about is 2.5$\sigma$ higher than central Au+Au 0-10\% collisions at $\textup{3 GeV}$. This indicates that some important in-medium mechanism for strangeness production and propagation may be missing for the large system in SMASH.


In summary, we report the first multi-differential measurement of $K^-$, $\phi(1020)$ and $\Xi^{-}$ production yields  and the $\phi/K^-$, $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ with the STAR experiment at RHIC. The measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio is about $5\sigma$ larger than the GCE limit ($\sim$0) in $\textup{0--10\%}$ and $\textup{10--40\%}$ central collisions. The statistical model prediction based on the Grand Canonical Ensemble underestimates the measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio. Both the results of $\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios favor the model with the Canonical Ensemble treatment for strangeness and a small strangeness correlation length parameter, $r_c$, in $\textup{0--10\%}$ central Au+Au collisions. The transport models including the resonance decays can reasonably describe both our measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio at this energy and the trend of $\phi/\Xi^-$ at lower energies. Our results suggest a significant change in the strangeness production at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ compared to higher collision energies, providing new insights into the Equation-of-State of QCD matter in the high baryon density region close to the strangeness production threshold~\cite{KO_sQM17}. Furthermore, the sub-threshold $\Xi^-$ measurement could serve as a probe of a new state of QCD matter and the energy dissipation during the collision in the future~\cite{yong2021double,Ks0_Lambda_HADES}.

\section{supplemental material}

Figure~\ref{fig:phimTSpectra22} shows the acceptance $\times$ efficiency corrected $K^-$, $\phi$ meson and $\Xi^-$ invariant yields as a function of $m_T-m_0$ for various rapidity ranges in 10--40\% centrality Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. The $K^-$, $\phi$-meson and $\Xi^-$ spectra in some rapidity intervals are scaled with arbitrary factors indicated in the figure for clarity. Dashed and solid lines depict fits to the spectra with the $m_T$-exponential function in order to extrapolate the unmeasured $p_T$ ranges. Figure~\ref{fig:phimTSpectra23} shows the similar plot for $K^-$ and $\phi$ meson in 40--60\% centrality collisions.
