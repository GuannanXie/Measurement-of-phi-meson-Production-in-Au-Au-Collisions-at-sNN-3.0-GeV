We report on the first measurement of $\phi$-meson production and $\phi/K^-$ ratio in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ with the STAR experiment under fixed target configuration at RHIC. $\phi$-mesons are measured through their hadronic decay channel, $\phi\rightarrow K^+K^-$. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of $\phi$-mesons and $K^-$ are presented in different centrality and rapidity intervals. The total production yields and $\phi/K^-$ ratio in $4\pi$ acceptance are calculated and compared to thermal model predictions. The grand canonical ensemble (GCE) calculation shows a clear discrepancy from our measurement. Our data favors the canonical ensemble (CE) model with a strangeness correlation length $(r_c   \sim 3.2_{-0.3}^{+0.2} \rm{fm})$ in 0--10\% central Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$.

% \label{introduction}

Relativistic heavy ion physics is aimed at detail investigation of phase structures of strongly interacting matter, governed by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), under extreme high temperature and density conditions~\cite{akiba2015hot,StarWhitePaper}. Particle production has been studied to investigate the properties of the produced QCD matter in heavy ion collisions. Strange quarks provide a unique method to study the hot QCD medium in heavy-ion collisions since their mass is comparable to the QCD scale as well as to the temperature of the produced medium~\cite{Rafelski:1982pu,Koch:1986ud}. Strange quark dynamics play an important role in understanding the QCD Equation-of-State particularly at high baryon density region. 

Statistical thermal models have often been used to characterize the thermal properties of the produced system~\cite{BraunMunzinger:2003zd,Redlich_CE}. In these models, the Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE) and the Canonical Ensemble (CE) statistical descriptions can be applied to conserved electric charge, baryon number, and strangeness number in order to compute the final state particle yields. Both GCE and CE models are able to describe various particle yields including strange particles produced in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC at center-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$) greater than 7.7\,GeV. It has been argued that at lower energies, strangeness number needs to be conserved on an event-by-event basis described by the CE, which leads to a reduction in the yields of hadrons with non-zero strangeness number (``Conanical Suppression")~\cite{Redlich:2001kb}.

$\phi(1020)$ meson is the lightest bound state of $s\bar{s}$ with zero net strangeness number. The $\phi$ meson production in elementary collisions is suppressed compared to other strange hadrons due to the QCD Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka rule. So with the GCE description, the $\phi/K^-$ ratio is expected to fall off when the collision energy decreases. With the CE description, $\phi$ meson production is not affected by the event-by-event strangeness number conservation, unlike other strange hadrons ($K^-$, $\Lambda$ etc.). Therefore, the $\phi/K^-$ ratio is expected to increase with decreasing collision energy in models using the CE treatment for strangeness. The $\phi/K^-$ ratio offers a unique test to scrutinize thermodynamic properties of strange quarks in the hot and dense QCD environment.

Measurements from the AGS, SPS, RHIC and LHC show that the $\phi/K^-$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions stays remarkably flat ($\sim$0.15) at collisions energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}>$5\,GeV. Recent measurements of the $\phi/K^-$ ratio in heavy-ion collisions at the collision energies below the $\phi$ production threshold in NN collisions ($\sim$2.9\,GeV) from the HADES and FOPI Collaborations show a hint of relative enhancement compared to those from high energies at RHIC and the LHC~\cite{E917_phi,NA49_phi,FOPI_phi_AlAl,FOPI_phi_NiNi,HADES_phi_ArKCl,HADES_phi_AuAu}, %These enhancement were observed both in Au+Au collisions and also in the lighter system such as Ni+Ni, Ar+KCl and Al+Al at low energies.
indicative of the necessity of the CE description for strangeness production at these energies. In the CE model, a correlation length parameter $r_c$ is often used to characterize the volume size to account for local strangeness conservation, which remains largely uncertain with the existing measurements.
%The grand canonical ensemble (GCE) statistical model shows a discrepancy with the measured data while the calculations from canonical ensemble (CE) with different strangeness correlation length ($r_c$) can reasonable reproduce this feature. In the GCE, the strangeness was conserved in average for the collision system, while the $r_c$ parameter in CE model corresponding to the strangeness local conserved volume size. Due to the uncertainties in the current measurements, a solid determination on the $r_c$ and distinguish those different models are still missing. 
The RHIC Beam Energy Scan phase-II program, including both collider and fixed target setups with the STAR experiment, covers a center-of-mass energy range of 3.0--19.6\,GeV. This offers us a great opportunity to conduct precise measurement of the energy dependence of $\phi/K^-$ ratio at low collision energies, which is crucial to understand the strangeness dynamics as well as the medium properties at high baryon density regions in QCD.
%to 7.7 GeV which can map the unmeasured cms range to have a better constrain on the model calculations and understanding the strangeness production mechanisms~\cite{}.

The dataset used in this analysis consists of Au+Au collision at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ collected by the STAR experiment operated under the fixed target (FXT) setup in the 2018 RHIC run. For the FXT configuration used here, a single beam was provided by RHIC with total energy equal to 3.85 GeV and incident on a gold target of thickness 0.25 mm corresponding to a 1\% interaction probability.
%to minimize the pileup and energy loss effect in target.
The target is installed inside the vacuum pipe, 2 cm below the center of the beam axis, and located 200 cm to the west of STAR center. The main detectors used are the Time Projection Chamber (TPC)~\cite{TPC}, the Time of Flight (TOF) detector~\cite{TOF} and the Beam-Beam Counter (BBC). The trigger system is provide by the BBC detector, while the tracking and particle identification are done using the TPC and TOF. Events are selected with the offline reconstructed collision vertex within 1.5 cm of the target centers along the beam direction. Approximately 2.6$\times 10^{8}$ minimum bias (MB) triggered events pass the selection criteria and are used in this analysis. 

The centrality class is selected using measured charged particle multiplicity within the TPC acceptance. 
A Monte Carlo Glauber model in conjunction with a negative binomial distribution used to model particle production are optimized is order to best match the data and determine the centrality class. Due to the trigger inefficiency in the low multiplicity region (corresponding to most peripheral collision), and finite contribution to our interested signals, we only report the results from 0--60\% centrality class in this paper.

The $\phi$-mesons are reconstructed via the hadronic decay channel $\phi\rightarrow K^+K^-$ with a branching ratio ($B.R.$) of 49.2\%~\cite{pdg}. Charged kaon tracks are reconstructed with the TPC in a 0.5 T uniform magnetic field. The TPC tracks are required to contain at least 20 TPC hits (out a maximum of 45) to ensure a good tracking and avoid track splitting. Kaons tracks are identified via a combination of the ionization energy loss ($dE/dx$) measurement with the TPC and the time-of-flight ($tof$) measurement with the TOF detector, which have been extensively used in many prior STAR analyses. Due to the charge asymmetry for the particle yields at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$, a smaller yield for $K^-$ means a relative higher contaminations, thus a strict PID requiring both TPC and TOF are implemented~\cite{Xu:2008th,Shao:2005iu}. Both the TPC and TOF detectors have full azimuthal coverage with a pseudo-rapidity range of 0$<$\,$\eta$\,$<$\,1.88 for TPC and 0$<$\,$\eta$\,$<$\,1.5 for TOF in FXT mode~\cite{TPC,TOF}.

\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:phiSignal} (a) shows the invariant mass distribution of $K^+K^-$ pairs in the $p_{T}$ region of 0.4--1.6 GeV/$c$ for 0--60\% centrality collisions. The combinatorial background is estimated with the mixed-event (ME) technique in which $K^+$ and $K^-$ from different events of similar characteristics (centrality, event plane angle) are paired. The mixed-event spectra are normalized to the same-event (SE) distributions in the mass range of 1.04--1.08\,GeV/$c^2$. After the subtraction of the combinatorial background, the remainder distribution is shown as red solid circles. The reminder $K^+K^-$ invariant mass distributions are fit with a Breit-Wigner for the signal plus a linear function represent the remaining correlated background. The $\phi$-meson raw yields are extracted from the Breit-Wigner function fit results within the corresponding mass windows. The extracted $\phi$ signal shape is consistent with its intrinsic properties convoluted with the detector smearing effect due to finite momentum resolution. The reconstructed $\phi$-meson acceptance ($p_T$ vs. $y_{cm}$) in the collision center-of-mass frame is shown Fig.~\ref{fig:phiSignal} (b). The target is located around $y_{cm}$ = -1.05 using the convention where the beam travels in the positive direction. The red curve represent the TPC and TOF acceptance edge. The reconstructed $\phi$-mesons in this analysis cover the range from target to mid-rapidity.


The reconstructed $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ raw yields are calculated in each centrality and $p_{T}$ bin within each rapidity slices. The corrected $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ production invariant yields are then calculated using the following formula:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
 \frac{d^2N}{2\pi p_{T}dp_{T}dy} = \frac{1}{\rm B.R.} \times \frac{N^{\rm raw}}{N_{\rm evt} 2\pi p_{T}\Delta p_{T}\Delta y} \times \frac{1}{\varepsilon_{\rm TPC}\times\varepsilon_{\rm PID}},
  \end{aligned}
\label{equ:invariantyield}
\end{equation}
where B.R. is the corresponding decay branching ratio, $N^{\rm raw}$ is the reconstructed raw counts, and $N_{\rm evt}$ is the total numbers of events in the corresponding centrality bins. The raw yields are corrected for the TPC acceptance and tracking efficiency, $\varepsilon_{\rm TPC}$, and the particle identification efficiency, $\varepsilon_{\rm PID}$.

Solid and dashed black lines depict exponential function fits to the measured data points.}
\label{fig:phimTSpectra} 
\end{figure}

The uncertainty of the raw yield extraction is estimated by changing the raw yield counting method from the fit (Breit-Wigner function for $K^+K^-$ invariant mass pair distribution) to histogram bin counting. The maximum difference between these scenarios is then converted to the standard deviation and added to the systematic uncertainties. The contribution varies by $p_T$, rapidity, and centrality since the statistics are correlated, but the overall contribution is less than 5\% for the total cross section. The uncertainty of the TPC acceptance and efficiency correction $\varepsilon_{\rm TPC}$ is estimated via the standard procedure in STAR by comparing the TPC track distributions between real data and the embedding data, then by varying the track quality cuts such as the number of fit points and DCA used for tracking. After correcting for the corresponding efficiency for each scenario, the difference is added to the systematic uncertainties. This contribution for $\phi$-meson is about 13-16\% and 4-5\% for $K^-$ in the reported 3 centrality bins and results to 10-13\% in the measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio. The uncertainty of the PID efficiency correction is estimated in a similar way by varying the PID selection cuts such as the TPC $n\sigma_{K}$ and TOF $1/\beta$ and then propagated to the final corrected yield. This source contributes 2-3\% to the total systematic uncertainty. For the $p_T$ integrated yield, one important systematic source comes from the extrapolation to the full $p_T$ range due to limited acceptance. We estimate this by varying several different fitting functions including Levy, Blast-Wave, $m_T$-exponential, $p_T$-exponential, $p_T$-Gaussian~\cite{STAR_particleYield}. The maximum difference between these scenarios to the default one ($m_T$-exponential) is quoted as the systematic uncertainty from this source. This contribution for $\phi$-meson is about 14-17\% and 5-7\% for $K^-$. For each individual $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ measurement, some of the uncertainties are correlated or partially correlated (e.g. TPC and PID). Thus for the $\phi/K^-$ ratio measurement, in order to avoid the correlation we vary the above cuts simultaneously for $\phi$-meson and $K^-$, then quote the final ratio difference directly as the systematic uncertainties.

Figure~\ref{fig:phimTSpectra} shows the efficiency corrected $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ invariant yields as a function of transverse mass kinetic energy ($m_T-m_0$) for various rapidity regions in 0--10\% central Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. The $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ spectra in some rapidity intervals are scaled with arbitrary factors indicated in the figure for clarity. Dashed and solid lines depict fits to the spectra with the $m_T$ exponential function, which is used to extrapolate the unmeasured $p_T$ ranges. The fitted inverse slope parameters indicate harder spectra for $\phi$-meson compared to $K^-$. The inverse slope parameters gradually decrease from mid-rapidity to forward/backward rapidity and follow well with the $T_{\rm eff}/\cosh(y)$ distribution. The inverse slope parameter at $y=0$, $T_{\rm eff}$ is extracted to be ($176\pm10_{stat}\pm13_{sys}$)\,MeV for $\phi$ meson in 0--10\% central collisions, and this agrees with the collision energy dependence trend from other experiments~\cite{HADES_phi_AuAu,FOPI_phi_NiNi,FOPI_phi_AlAl,HADES_phi_ArKCl,NA49_phi}.


The rapidity density distributions are obtained for $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ by integrating the measured data points in Fig.~\ref{fig:phimTSpectra} and using the exponential fits to extrapolate to the unmeasured region of phase space. The rapidity distributions are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:phiYSpectra} for Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ for three different centralities. The full symbols show the measured data, while the open ones are reflected data with respect to $y=0$ in the center-of-mass frame. Solid lines depict Gaussian function fits to the data points and are used to extrapolate to the unmeasured rapidity region. In the fitting procedure, the center of the Gaussian was fixed at zero to take into account the symmetry of the reaction. By integrating the measured rapidity and using the Gaussian fit to extrapolate, the multiplicity of the $\phi$-meson and $K^-$ per triggered event are obtained respectively.


The excitation function of $\phi/K^-$ ratio is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio} as a function of collision energy $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$, including data from the AGS and SPS at higher energies and data from SIS at lower energies than the one presented here. The colored full symbols show these measurements in three centrality bins in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. The measured $\phi$ and $K^-$ yields in 4$\pi$, the $\phi/K^-$ ratios and the extracted $T_{\rm eff}$ parameters in different centrality bins are listed
%is about $0.23$ for 0--10\% central , $0.25$ for 10--40\% and $0.34$ for 40--60\% centrality collisions as detailed list 
in Tab.~\ref{table:yieldTratio}. The $\phi/K^-$ ratio from this measurement is significantly ($5\sigma$) above the GCE prediction of 0, and slightly higher than the approximately constant value ($\approx0.15$) at high energies for $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\geqslant$ 5\,GeV~\cite{NA49_phi,NA49_piK,NA49_piK2,E917_phi,ALICE_phi_2p7TeV,STAR_phi_64a200GeV}. The measured data points follow well with the energy dependence trend, which the value gradually increase with the energy descent at low $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$. %Our measured data points confirmed this enhancement observation which limited by the precision in the previous measurements. 
Though there is no clear difference in the $\phi/K^-$ ratio between 0--10\% and 10--40\% centrality bins, the result in the most peripheral collisions 40--60\% bin shows a hint of larger value. As a comparison, a previous measurement in $p$+$p$ collisions at 2.7 GeV shows that $\phi/K^- = 1.04\pm0.23$ ~\cite{ANKE_phi}.

%Despite the different collision system and size including Au+Au, Ni+Ni, Ar+KCl and Al+Al, all of them observed substantially larger ratio in the low energy compared to high energies. 
Various curves in the Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio} represent the predictions from several models calculation. The Grand Canonical Ensemble (GCE) uses the chemical freeze-out parameters derived from the fits of experimental data at mid-rapidity with details in~\cite{ANDRONIC2006167_SHM}. The strangeness ($\mu_s$) is conserved on average in GCE, where the model does not contain strangeness suppression factor which accounts for the non-equilibrium in the strangeness sector. The model reproduces well the AGS data, while slightly deviating from the SPS measurements, despite the model calculations are for midrapidity yield and the experimental measurements are for total multiplicity. It is clear that the model fails to describe the data at low energies including our new measurements at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$, which may indicate the thermal particle phase-space at low energies is far from the GCE limit and the local treatment of strangeness conservation is crucial~\cite{BraunMunzinger:2003zd,Redlich_CE}. In the canonical approach, the correlation length, $r_c$, relates to a reduction of the particle production phase space inside which the production of the open strangeness is canonically conserved. There are 4 different $r_c$ calculations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio}. With a large $r_c$ = 6.2\,fm, the CE calculation gives approximately the similar result as the GCE calculation. Assuming a linear interpolation with the $r_c$ calculations, and taking into account the statistics and systematic uncertainties of the measured data, our result favors $r_c = 3.2_{-0.3}^{+0.2}$\,fm in 0--10\% , $3.2_{-0.3}^{+0.1}$\,fm in 10--40\% and $2.7_{-0.3}^{+0.3}$\,fm in 40--60\% centrality Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$. Note, the calculation using $r_c = 1.2$\,fm is consistent with the measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio in $p+p$ collisions at 2.7 GeV from ANKE~\cite{ANKE_phi,HADES_phi_ArKCl}. 
%which is consistent with our centrality dependence trend.

Hadronic transport models such as Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) are widely used in the high baryon density range to study properties of the produced dense matter. In the model~\cite{Steinheimer_2015_UrQMD}, new decay channels from high mass baryon resonance to $\phi$ and $\Xi^-$ are deployed. The relevant decay branching fraction was determined by fitting the experiment data in $p$+$p$ collisions~\cite{ANKE_phi}. From the comparison shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:phi2Kratio}, the UrQMD calculation for central ($\rm{b}<5\rm{fm}$) Au+Au collisions agree with the data points at low ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ including our new measurement, while clearly underestimating the measurements at high $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\geqslant$ 5\,GeV. Another hadronic transport approach called Simulating Many Accelerated Strongly-interacting Hadrons (SMASH) attempts to incorporate the newest available experimental data from both elementary hadronic cross section and dilepton invariant mass spectra to constrain the resonance branching ratios~\cite{Elfner_SMASH}. The $\phi/K^-$ ratio was reasonably reproduced using SMASH along the low ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ range, but the model overestimates our result in central Au+Au collisions at 3\,GeV. Note that each individual ($\phi$, $K^-$) transverse mass spectra predicted in SMASH also overestimate the measured Au+Au results from HADES.
%, but reasonably describe those in the lighter Ar+KCl system. 
This indicates a strangeness-suppression mechanism may be missing for the large system in SMASH.

In summary, we report the first measurement of $\phi(1020)$ meson production and $\phi/K^-$ ratio in Au+Au collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ with the STAR experiment at RHIC. The measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio is about $5\sigma$ larger than zero in 0--10\% and 10--40\% centrality collisions. The statistical model prediction based on the Grand Canonical Ensemble clearly underestimate the measured data. Our result favors the model with the Canonical Ensemble treatment for strangeness and the strangeness correlation length parameter can be constrained to $(r_c \sim 3.2_{-0.3}^{+0.2} \rm{fm})$ in 0--10\% central Au+Au collisions. The transport models including the resonance decays can reasonably describe our measured $\phi/K^-$ ratio result at this energy. Our results suggest a significant change in the strangeness production at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = \rm{3\,GeV}}$ compared to higher collision energies, shedding new insights in understanding the Equation-of-State of QCD matter in the high baryon density region. 

%Our data are expected to offer significant constrains towards the understanding of the strangeness production mechanisms and the EoS of the nuclear matter produced in the high baryon density region.
